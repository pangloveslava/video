Switzerland won this tournament four times in a row before Canada unseated them a year ago. Can Silvana Tirinzoni lead them right back to the top of the summit?

Team Homan secured their place in the championship match with a dramatic 6-5 extra-end victory over host nation South Korea, led by Eunji Gim. With Canada clinging to a one-point lead in the 10th end and without the hammer, Rachel Homan executed a stunning double takeout to force Korea to a single point, sending the match into an extra end. A crucial mistake by Gim in the final frame allowed Canada to claim victory and advance.

18-time champions Canada have had to do things the hard way at Uijeongbu 2025. Despite finishing with the same 10-2 record as South Korea, they had to go through the playoffs, where they demolished Scotland before bouncing out the hosts.

Switzerland topped the round robin phase with an 11-1 record. That sole blemish? A 7-6 defeat at the hands of Canada.

It shouldn’t, given the juggernaut success of Rachel Homan and her Canadian crew — including their capture of the world honour last winter — and the record run of Silvana Tirinzoni and her Swiss squad in scoring the four such titles ahead of Canada’s triumph a year ago.

Switzerland, ranked second in the world, boasts an impressive 64-20 record this season. Led by skip Silvana Tirinzoni, with last rock thrower Alina Paetz, second Selina Witschonke, and lead Carole Howald, the Swiss team has been a dominant force on the curling circuit. They claimed three tour victories this season, including the prestigious European Curling Championships in November.

This gold medal clash promises to be a battle of strategy and precision. Canada will look to capitalize on their past dominance over Switzerland, while Tirinzoni’s squad aims to break their losing streak and claim the world title. With both teams displaying top-tier curling throughout the tournament, fans can expect a thrilling contest for the sport’s ultimate prize.

And it was Homan & Co. taking down Tirinzoni in the 7-5 final at last year’s worlds in Sydney, N.S. Two spectacular shots by the superstar skip from Ottawa proved to be the difference — her first was a “rocket double” to sit three, and the second was a split of her own guard to roll both it and the shooter into the house to out-count the Swiss stones for a dynamic three.

Rachel Homan's curling team went the distance to reach the final of the women's world championship.

Homan’s brilliance was on full display on Friday in Uijeongbu. She knocked out two Korean stones with a brilliant shot in the 10th end to keep Canada alive. Although Eun-ji would get the equalizer in the 10th end, the Korean team could not execute their throw in the 11th end, giving Canada the 6-5 win.

Homan, Tracy Fleury, Emma Miskew and Sarah Wilkes navigated waves of momentum swings in a 6-5 win in an extra end over South Korea's Gim Eun-ji in Saturday's semifinal in Uijeongbu, South Korea.

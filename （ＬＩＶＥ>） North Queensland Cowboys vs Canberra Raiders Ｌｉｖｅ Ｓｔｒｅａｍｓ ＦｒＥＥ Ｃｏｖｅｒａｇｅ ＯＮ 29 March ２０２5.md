## （ＬＩＶＥ>） North Queensland Cowboys vs Canberra Raiders Ｌｉｖｅ Ｓｔｒｅａｍｓ ＦｒＥＥ Ｃｏｖｅｒａｇｅ ＯＮ 29 March ２０２5 
The North Queensland Cowboys, currently 16th on the 2025 NRL Premiership ladder, will take on the 8th-placed Canberra Raiders in the fourth round of the season this weekend.

While the Cowboys showed positive signs in the last match, defeats to Sea Eagles (42-12), Sharks (36-12), and Broncos (26-16) is concerning. This is a significant setback for a side with top-four ambitions, having reached the semifinals last year.

Consistency has been an issue for the Cowboys - while they did make it to the Finals in 2024 by winning eight of their last ten games, they secured just one win through April and May. However, on the positive, they have won five of their last six meetings against their next opponents.

The Raiders, on the other hand, started the season strongly with back-to-back wins over the Warriors and Broncos. However, they look a heavy defeat in the last round, losing 40-12 to the Sea Eagles, where they were trailing 30-0 at half-time.

As they visit Queensland, recent history is not on their side - having won just one of their last five games at this venue. Further, Morgan Smithies has been ruled out of this match due to a concussion.

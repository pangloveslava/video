In Saturday's Sprint race, Lewis Hamilton earned his first win since moving to Ferrari, shaking off a poor debut that saw him finish just 10th. Can Hamilton mount a challenge this week?

Fans are expecting big things from the 2025 F1 season, and largely, they got what they wanted from the first race. Sure, Lando Norris winning wasn't a huge surprise, but we got competitive racing from an open field. And you get the feeling that there is a lot more to come. At least, that's what Lewis Hamilton will be hoping for.

Mclaren's Lando Norris won the first race of the season, the Melbourne Grand Prix, overcoming the likes of defending champion Red Bull‚Äôs Max Verstappen and teammate George Russell.

Verstappen is the won last year's edition of the Chinese Grand Prix and will hope to repeat the feat as he looks to open his account for the campaign. Lewis Hamilton will also look to improve upon his 10th-placed finish at Melbourne last week in Shanghai.

The front row of this race consists of Piastri and Mercedes driver George Russell. The second row is Piastri's McLaren teammate Lando Norris and Norris's chief rival in the 2025 title hunt, Max Verstappen.

After storming to victory in the Sprint race, Lewis Hamilton will be eyeing up pole but how will the Ferrari fare in a one-lap shootout against the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, not to mention Red Bull's Max Verstappen?

Ferrari owns the third row, with Hamilton starting fifth and teammate Charles Leclerc sixth.

The Chinese GP 2025 Sprint weekend promises to be an exhilarating event, with the new sprint format adding an extra layer of excitement to the proceedings. With the top drivers and teams vying for supremacy, the stage is set for a thrilling battle on the track. Can reigning champion Max Verstappen continue his dominance, or will rivals like Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc mount a challenge? The Chinese GP 2025 is shaping up to be an unforgettable event.

Isack Hadjar of Racing Bulls crashed on the formation lap last week in Australia, but he starts seventh for this race, next to fellow rookie Kimi Antonelli of Mercedes. Yuki Tsunoda and Alex Albon round out the top 10 on the starting grid.
